## 🧒 What is a Comment?

A **comment** is a message you write inside your code, but the browser ignores it. It’s **just for humans**, not for the computer.

Think of it like putting a sticky note on your homework saying “Don't forget to check this part!” 😄

## 💬 How to Write a Comment in CSS

You write a comment like this:

```css
/* This is a comment */
```

Anything between `/*` and `*/` is a comment!

---

### ✅ Example:

```css
/* Make all text red */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* This box needs more spacing */
.box {
  margin: 20px;
}
```

➡️ The browser **ignores** the comment, but people reading the code understand **why** you wrote that CSS.

- ✅ To explain your code
- ✅ To remind yourself of things
- ✅ To make teamwork easier
