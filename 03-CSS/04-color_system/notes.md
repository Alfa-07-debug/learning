### 🎯 **What is a Color System?**

A color system is just a way to **describe a color** using numbers or letters so the computer understands what we want.

## 🌈 1. **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**

RGB stands for **Red, Green, Blue**. It's like mixing paint — if you mix these 3 colors in different amounts, you can make any color!

### 👉 Format:
```css
color: rgb(red, green, blue);
```

- Each value can be from `0` to `255`
- `0` means none of that color
- `255` means the most of that color

### 🧒 Examples:
```css
color: rgb(255, 0, 0);   /* Full red */
color: rgb(0, 255, 0);   /* Full green */
color: rgb(0, 0, 255);   /* Full blue */
color: rgb(255, 255, 0); /* Red + Green = Yellow */
```

## #️⃣ 2. **Hexadecimal (Hex)**

Hex is like a **secret code** made with numbers (0-9) and letters (A-F). It always starts with a `#`.

### 👉 Format:
```css
color: #RRGGBB;
```

- `RR` = Red
- `GG` = Green
- `BB` = Blue
- Each pair goes from `00` to `FF` (which is like `0` to `255` in RGB)

### 🧒 Examples:
```css
color: #FF0000; /* Red */
color: #00FF00; /* Green */
color: #0000FF; /* Blue */
color: #FFFF00; /* Yellow */
```

### 🔍 RGB vs Hex — Which One to Use?

They both do the **same thing**, just in a different language.
- RGB is easier to read and understand at first.
- Hex is shorter and looks cool in code!
