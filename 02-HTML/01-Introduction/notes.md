### 🌐 What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.

But don’t worry about that big name 😄  
Just think of HTML like the **skeleton** or **building blocks** of every webpage. 🏗️

If a website was a robot 🤖 —  
- HTML is its **body**  
- CSS is its **clothes**  
- JavaScript is its **brain**

So without HTML, there is **no website**!

### 🧱 HTML Page Structure (Think LEGO house)

Here’s what a simple HTML page looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, Arif!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now let me explain like a story 📖:

| Tag         | What it does                            |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `<!DOCTYPE html>` | Tells the browser “Hey! I’m using HTML5” 🚦 |
| `<html>`     | This is the **house** for the whole webpage 🏠 |
| `<head>`     | This is the **brain/helmet** 🧠 – It has settings like the title, meta info |
| `<title>`    | What shows in the **browser tab** (like “YouTube”) 🏷️ |
| `<body>`     | This is where all the **visible stuff** goes – headings, text, images 🖼️ |

### 🧠 Quick Summary:
- HTML is like the **bones** of a webpage 🦴
- You build it with **tags** like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
- It always starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` to say “I’m using HTML5!”
