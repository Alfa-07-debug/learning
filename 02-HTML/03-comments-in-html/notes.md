## 💭 What is a Comment in HTML?

A **comment** is something you write in your code, but the browser ignores it. It’s only for **you** or **other developers** to read later.

## ✍️ How to Write a Comment

Here’s the magic format for comments:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

Yup! You put your message **between** `<!--` and `-->`.

---

## 🧠 Why Use Comments?

- To **explain** what your code does
- To **remind** yourself of something
- To **hide** code you don’t want to run right now

---

## 🧪 Example 1: Explaining code

```html
<!-- This is the main heading -->
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
```

The comment says what the `<h1>` is for — but it won’t show up on the webpage!

---

## 🧪 Example 2: Hiding code

```html
<!-- <p>This paragraph is hidden for now.</p> -->
```

This paragraph won’t show up on the site because it's inside a comment!

---

## ❗ Be Careful!
Don’t nest comments like this — it **won’t work**:

```html
<!-- <!-- Wrong comment --> -->
```

Stick to one comment at a time!

---

### ✅ Recap!
- HTML comments start with `<!--` and end with `-->`
- They’re **not shown** on the webpage
- Use them to **explain** or **hide** parts of your code
