### ðŸ§  What does *semantic* mean?

**"Semantic"** just means **"meaningful."**  
So, **semantic tags** are HTML tags that **clearly describe** what their content is all about.

Instead of using a general-purpose `<div>`, you use special tags that **tell the browser and developers** what the content inside them means.
