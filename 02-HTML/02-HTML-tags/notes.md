## 🏷️ What are HTML Tags?

HTML **tags** are like **magic labels** that tell the computer what to show on the webpage.

For example:
- `<p>` is for **paragraph**
- `<h1>` is for a **big heading**
- `<img>` is for **pictures**

You write them like this:

```html
<tagname> Content goes here </tagname>
```

This is called an **HTML element** (a full set).

## ✨ Structure of HTML Tags

Let’s break it down with an example:

```html
<h1>Hello, Arif!</h1>
```

| Part | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `<h1>` | This is the **opening tag** – it starts the element |
| `Hello, Arif!` | This is the **content** – what will be shown |
| `</h1>` | This is the **closing tag** – it ends the element |

So together it’s called an **HTML Element**:
```
Opening tag + Content + Closing tag = HTML Element
```

## 🧢 Self-Closing Tags (No Closing Needed!)

Some tags don’t need to be closed! They’re like a cap with no bottom 👒

Examples:
```html
<br>   → Line break  
<hr>   → Horizontal line  
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="cute cat"> → Image
```

These are called **void elements**.

## 🧠 Tip: HTML is Case-Insensitive
That means:
```html
<p>hello</p>
```
is the same as:
```html
<P>hello</P>
```

But we **always** use **lowercase** like `<p>` for neat code! ✅

### ✅ Recap Time!
- Tags start with `<` and end with `>`
- They usually come in pairs: `<tagname> ... </tagname>`
- Some are self-closing like `<br>` or `<img>`
- Tags tell the browser what each part of the webpage is!
