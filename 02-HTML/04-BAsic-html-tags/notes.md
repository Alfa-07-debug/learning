## 🧱 Topic: Basic HTML Tags

An HTML tag is like a label or command that tells the web browser what to do with the content inside it.

Imagine HTML tags as containers 📦 for different types of content like headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

### 📌 Subtopics:

---

### 1️⃣ **Heading Tag (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)**
Headings are like the titles of your content. Big ones for important stuff, smaller ones for less important.

```html
<h1>This is a Big Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a bit smaller</h2>
<h3>Even smaller...</h3>
<h4>...</h4>
<h5>...</h5>
<h6>This is the smallest heading</h6>
```

👉 **Use Case:** Show titles like "Welcome to My Page" or "My Hobbies"

---

### 2️⃣ **Paragraph Tag (`<p>`)**
Used to write **normal text**.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph. You can write your story here.</p>
```

👉 It adds space before and after itself!

---

### 3️⃣ **Anchor Tag (`<a>`)**
Used to **create links** to other pages, websites, or emails!

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>
```

💡 You can link to:
- Websites → `href="https://example.com"`
- Email → `href="mailto:arif@gmail.com"`
- Phone → `href="tel:1234567890"`

---

### 4️⃣ **Image Tag (`<img>`)**
Used to **add pictures** to your webpage.

```html
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="Cute Cat" />
```

🧠 Attributes:
- `src` = where the image is
- `alt` = what to show if the image doesn’t load

---

### 5️⃣ **Break Tag (`<br>`)**
Used to **go to the next line** without starting a new paragraph.

```html
<p>Hello<br>World</p>
```

👉 It breaks the line right there!

---

### 6️⃣ **Bold, Italic, and Underline Tags**

```html
<b>This is bold text</b><br>
<i>This is italic text</i><br>
<u>This is underlined text</u>
```

🧠 These make text look **different** (but not more important)!

---

### 7️⃣ **Big and Small Tags**

```html
<big>This is big text</big><br>
<small>This is small text</small>
```

👉 Make your text look **bigger or smaller** than normal.

---

### 8️⃣ **Horizontal Rule (`<hr>`)**
Adds a **horizontal line** (like a divider).

```html
<hr>
```

💡 Use it to **separate sections** of your page.

---

### 9️⃣ **Subscript & Superscript Tags**

```html
<p>Water formula: H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p>Superman<sup>™</sup></p>
```

- `<sub>` → goes **down** (used in formulas like H₂O)
- `<sup>` → goes **up** (used for powers like 10⁴)

---

### 🔟 **Pre Tag (`<pre>`)**
Keeps **spaces and line breaks** exactly how you type them.

```html
<pre>
  This is
     exactly how
    I typed it.
</pre>
```
Great for code snippets or poems!
