### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Git Clone**  
When you want to work on an existing project from **GitHub** or another remote repository, you use `git clone`. This command creates a local copy of a repository, so you can make changes to it on your computer.

#### How to Use Git Clone:

1. **Find the repository URL**  
   Go to the **GitHub repository** page and click the **green "Code" button**. Copy the **HTTPS URL** (it will look something like `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`).

2. **Clone the repository**  
   In your **Terminal** or **Command Prompt**, go to the folder where you want to store the project and type:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

   - Replace `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git` with the URL you copied.
   - This command will download the repository to your local machine, creating a folder with the project name.

#### Example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git
```

This clones the **Hello-World** repository into a folder named **Hello-World** on your computer. üñ•Ô∏è

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Git Status**  
`git status` is used to check the **current state** of your working directory and staging area. It tells you which files are modified, added, or ready to be committed.

#### How to Use Git Status:

In your **Terminal** or **Command Prompt**, type:

```bash
git status
```

#### What Git Status Shows You:
- **Untracked files:** These are files you‚Äôve created but haven‚Äôt added to Git yet. Git doesn‚Äôt know about them.
- **Changes not staged for commit:** These are files you‚Äôve edited but haven't staged to be saved to your local Git repository.
- **Changes to be committed:** These are the files you‚Äôve staged and are ready to be saved (committed) to Git.

---

### Example:

1. After cloning a repo and making changes:

```bash
git status
```

It might show something like this:

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   index.html
  modified:   style.css

Untracked files:
  newfile.txt
```

- **`modified:`** shows files that you‚Äôve edited but haven‚Äôt staged yet.
- **`Untracked files:`** shows files you‚Äôve added but Git isn‚Äôt tracking yet.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **How to Use Git Status with Other Commands:**

#### To Stage Changes:
If you want to stage the changes to a file, use:

```bash
git add <filename>
```

For example:

```bash
git add index.html
```

Then you can check the status again:

```bash
git status
```

It will show:

```
Changes to be committed:
  modified:   index.html
```

---

#### To Commit Changes:
Once you've staged the files, you can commit them using:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

---

### üéâ **Recap:**
- **`git clone`** copies a remote project to your computer so you can work on it locally.
- **`git status`** shows the current state of your project‚Äîwhether files are new, modified, or ready to commit.
