### 🧠 What does “undoing changes” mean?

Let’s say you were writing a cool story in your notebook 📓.  
But then…  
Oops! You made a mistake 😱

What do you do?

**You erase it!**  
Git also has ways to "erase" or "undo" things if you mess up.

---

## 🛠️ Ways to Undo in Git:

---

### 1️⃣ **Undo a change you made in the file (but didn’t save in Git yet)**  
You’re just scribbling but haven’t shown the teacher yet.

```bash
git checkout -- filename
```

🧽 This erases your scribbles and brings back the last saved version.  
> Like saying, “I want my file back the way it was before I messed with it!”

---

### 2️⃣ **Undo a file you added but didn’t commit yet**

You say:
> “Oops, I didn't mean to say I’m ready!”

```bash
git reset filename
```

Git removes that file from the “ready list” (staging area), but the file still exists on your computer.

---

### 3️⃣ **Undo a commit (take back something you already told the teacher)**

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

🧠 This is like whispering to the teacher:
> “Actually, I wasn’t ready yet... please forget that I raised my hand.”

It keeps your changes but takes your commit back.

---

### 4️⃣ **Delete all mistakes and start fresh (dangerous!)**

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

💣 This one is like hitting “UNDO EVERYTHING!”  
It resets everything to the last saved point.

⚠️ Be careful! This will throw away your changes. Like throwing your paper in the trash can. 🗑️
