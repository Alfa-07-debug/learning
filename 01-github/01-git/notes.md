### 🧠 **What is Git?**  
Git is like a **time machine** for your code.

Imagine you're writing a story in your notebook 📓.  
Every time you make changes, Git helps you **save a copy** — so you can go back to any version if you mess something up.

> 🧰 Git is a **tool** that tracks changes in your code and helps you **collaborate** with others without messing things up.

### 🎯 Real-life Example:  
You're building a website project called `my-portfolio`.  
As you keep adding features (like About Page, Contact Form), you can save **snapshots** of your work using Git.

If something breaks later, Git helps you **rewind to the working version**.  
Also, if you're working with friends, everyone can work on their part without stepping on each other's toes.

### 🔧 What Git helps with:
- ✅ Save progress (called commits)
- ✅ Go back in time (undo mistakes)
- ✅ Work together with a team
- ✅ Track who did what and when

---

### 🚀 How it fits in your project:
You usually run commands like:
```bash
git init         # start Git in your folder
git add .        # tell Git what to track
git commit -m "message"  # save the current version
```

Later you’ll learn how to connect it to GitHub 🧑‍💻
