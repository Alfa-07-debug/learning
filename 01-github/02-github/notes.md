### 🧠 **What is GitHub?**  
GitHub is like a **cloud locker** 🗄️ for your code projects.

You already know that Git helps you **save versions** of your code on your computer.  
Now, GitHub helps you **save that code on the internet** so that:
- You don’t lose it,
- You can access it from anywhere,
- You can share it with others.

> 🔗 Git = version control  
> ☁️ GitHub = online storage & teamwork space for Git projects

### 🎯 Real-life Example:  
Imagine you made a cool game using TypeScript on your laptop.  
You want to:
- Keep a backup ✔️  
- Show it to your friends ✔️  
- Get help from others to improve it ✔️  

You can push it to **GitHub**, and now it's online for anyone to see or collaborate.

### 🔧 What GitHub helps with:
- ✅ Backup your code
- ✅ Show your projects to the world 🌍
- ✅ Collaborate with friends and teams

### 🚀 How it fits with Git:
Once your project is on your computer and Git is tracking it, you connect Git to GitHub like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

Now your code is safe on GitHub 🔐
