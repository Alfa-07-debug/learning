### 🧠 What is a *Pull Request*?

Imagine you drew a cool rocket 🚀 on your paper and you want to **show it to the teacher** so they can add it to the big class mural on the wall 🖼️ (which is like the **main project**).

You raise your hand and say:  
> “Hey teacher! Can you please **pull** my drawing and **add it** to the big mural?”

That’s what a **pull request (PR)** is!

You’re asking the main project to **pull** your changes.

### 🛠️ When Do You Use a Pull Request?

1. You make changes in **your branch** (your own paper).
2. You push it to **GitHub** (your folder in the cloud).
3. Then you click **“New Pull Request”** on GitHub.

Now your teammates or teacher (project owner) can:
- 👀 Look at your work  
- 🗣️ Comment or suggest fixes  
- ✅ Approve and merge it into the main project

### ✨ Why It’s Cool

- It’s like **show and tell** for code! 📢  
- Everyone sees what’s being added  
- It keeps the project safe from mistakes
